Although the mean nitrogen budget of the Chesapeake Bay has been previously estimated from observations, uncertainties associated with interannually varying hydrological conditions remain. In this study, a land-estuarine-ocean biogeochemical modeling system is developed to quantify Chesapeake riverine nitrogen inputs, within-estuary nitrogen transformation processes and the ultimate export of nitrogen to the coastal ocean. Model skill was evaluated using extensive in situ and satellite-derived data, and a simulation using environmental conditions for 2001–2005 was conducted to quantify the Chesapeake Bay nitrogen budget. The five year simulation was characterized by large riverine inputs of nitrogen split roughly 60:40 between inorganic:organic components. Much of this was denitrified and buried within the estuarine system. A positive net annual ecosystemproduction for the bay further contributed to a large advective export of organic nitrogen to the shelf and negligible inorganic nitrogen export. Interannual variability was strong, particularly for the riverine nitrogen fluxes. In years with higher than average riverine nitrogen  inputs, most of this excess nitrogen (50–60%) was exported from the bay as organic nitrogen, with the remaining split between burial, denitrification, and inorganic export to the coastal ocean. In comparison to previous simulations using generic shelf biogeochemical model formulations inside the estuary, the estuarine biogeochemical model described here produced more realistic and significantly greater exports of organic nitrogen and lower exports of inorganic nitrogen to the shelf.</p><p><b>Collaborators:</b></p><p><b>Publications:</b></p><p><b>Datasets:</b><div class=\"list-group\"></div></p></div>",
            "model_desc": "<h3>Primary Chesapeake Bay Testbed models:</h3><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">ChesROMS-SRM, ChesROMS -ECB, ChesROMS-BGC</h4><p>ChesROMS (<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12237-011-9423-5\" target=\"_blank\">Xu et al. 2012</a>) is a community ocean modeling system for the Chesapeake Bay region, which is based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (<a href=\"http://www.myroms.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ROMS</a>), with significant adaptations for the Chesapeake Bay. The model uses a curvilinear horizontal grid and a stretched terrain-following vertical grid with twenty vertical layers. The model was developed to provide a community modeling system for hindcasts, nowcasts and forecasts of 3D hydrodynamic circulation, temperature and salinity.</p><p>Multiple ecosystem/biogeochemical models have been coupled with ChesROMS. These include the Simple Respiration Model (SRM) which uses a constant respiration rate throughout the water column, as well as more sophisticated biogeochemical including including <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JG002931/epdf\" target=\"_blank\">ChesROMS-ECB</a> and ChesROMS-BGC (see <a href=\"http://www.biogeosciences.net/13/2011/2016/\" target=\"blank\">Irby et al. 2016</a> for descriptions of these models.)</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">CBOFS-SRM</h4><p>The ROMS-based Chesapeake Bay Operational Forecast System (CBOFS; Lanerolle et al., 2011) is the operational model run by the NOAA National Ocean Service. A major difference between ChesROMS and CBOFS is the horizontal grid resolution; ChesROMS has 100x150 cells with about 1 to 7 km resolution; CBOFS has 332x291 cells with about 0.03 to 4 km resolution. Results from CBOFS are available at: <a href=\"https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/cbofs/cbofs.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/cbofs/cbofs.html</a>. The Simple Respiration Model (SRM) has recently been coupled with CBOFS; these results are only available on a developmental version of the official CBOFS website.</p><h3>Additional Chesapeake Bay models:</h3><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">ROMS-RCA</h4><p>Another ROMS-based model for the Chesapeake Bay has been independently developed and coupled to the Row-Column AESOP model (RCA; Testa et al., 2014). This version of ROMS (Li et al. 2005) is very similar to ChesROMS (including a similar horizontal resolution and number of vertical grid levels), but has slightly different hydrodynamic parameterizations and physical forcing.</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">CH3D-ICM</h4><p>The Curvilinear Hydrodynamics in Three Dimensions model (CH3D; Cerco et al., 2010), is compared with the ChesROMS models described above in Irby et al. (2016). This model employs a z-grid and is used by the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program as part of their regulatory operational modeling framework. The horizontal grid of CH3D-ICM has significantly greater resolution than ChesROMS, and is more equivalent to that of CBOFS. CH3D is coupled to the Integrated Compartment Model (ICM), which is a complex biogeochemical modeling system.</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">EFDC-SRM</h4><p>The Hydrodynamic-Eutrophication Model – Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) has been implemented for the Chesapeake Bay (Hong and Shen, 2012; Du and Shen, 2015), and also participated in the Chesapeake Bay Hypoxia Testbed comparison (Irby et al. 2016). The EFDC implementation used here is coupled to a version of the Simple Respiration Model (SRM).</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">FVCOM-ICM</h4><p>The ChesROMS models were also compared with the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM; Jiang and Xia, 2015). FVCOM employs an unstructured grid with ten vertical layers. Like CH3D, FVCOM is coupled to the ICM.</p>",

                "text": "<p>Hypoxia is a condition threatening the health of the Chesapeake Bay in which oxygen levels drop so low that fish and other animals are stressed or killed.  In the Bay, incidents of hypoxia-causing ‘dead zones’ are on the rise.</p><p>Hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay usually occurs in the summer and is primarily the result of human activities that deliver nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus into the Bay, although evidence from the testbed scientists suggest that wind forcing also plays a significant role. The added nutrients support surface blooms of algae, which eventually die, sink and are decomposed at the bottom of the Bay by oxygen-depleting bacteria. The resulting hypoxia can suffocate animals that cannot move away, such as shellfish, and — depending on how quickly the hypoxia develops — either kill or force into less suitable habitat free-swimming animals such as fish and crabs.</p><p>The Chesapeake Bay Testbed project is designed to provide a better understanding of the uncertainty inherent in predictions of properties such as salinity, temperature, chlorophyll, and nutrients; how this uncertainty contributes to the predictability of dissolved oxygen concentrations; and how to improve models of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the Chesapeake Bay. Model intercomparisons have demonstrated that the regulatory model used by the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program performs as well as many of the research models currently being used by the scientific community, giving both Chesapeake Bay Program Managers and academic scientists more confidence in the regulatory model. An ensemble mean of multiple models was found to have higher skill predicting hypoxia than any individual model (<a href=\"http://www.biogeosciences.net/13/2011/2016/\" target=\"_blank\">Irby et al., 2016</a>), illustrating the potential value of multi-model ensembles for decision making in the Chesapeake Bay.</p><p>A simple one-term model for hypoxia was developed for use in operational forecasts and is currently providing nowcasts and 2-day forecasts of Chesapeake Bay hypoxia on the <a href=\"http://www.vims.edu/research/topics/dead_zones/forecasts/cbay/\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia Institute of Marine Science website</a>. Forecasts from more sophisticated hypoxia models are in the developmental stage and will soon also be available on this website, along with other fields relevant to Chesapeake stakeholders (temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, water clarity). Efforts to transition this tool to NOAA’s <a href=\"https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/cbofs/cbofs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Chesapeake Bay Operational Forecast System (CBOFS)</a> and to the <a href=\"http://oceansmap.maracoos.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IOOS Mid-Atlantic Regional Association (MARACOOS) OceansMap</a> are ongoing. In a companion effort, the Chesapeake Hypoxia Testbed team has used multiple models to examine how nutrient load reductions will impact dissolved oxygen in the Chesapeake Bay, and has developed a method for quantifying the uncertainty associated with projected changes in hypoxia resulting from the implementation of these nutrient reductions. Ongoing work is focused on applying projected changes in temperature, freshwater flow, and sea level rise for a 2050 scenario to explore the impact climate change may have on future Chesapeake Bay hypoxia and the potential success of the nutrient reductions in attaining mandated estuarine water quality standards.</p><p>The results of this project are providing the modeling information that will enable best management practices and mitigation measures to be targeted on the human activities that have the most significant effect on decreasing nutrient transfer from land to coastal ecosystems in the region. Recent findings include (1) that the ChesROMS-1term model performs just as well when using nowcast forcing as it does when using hindcast forcing, (2) that ignoring precipitation/evaporation and underestimating riverine freshwater inputs may be causing a high salinity bias in the official version of CBOFS, (3) that nutrient load reduction scenarios conducted with both the regulatory EPA model and our ChesROMS-BGC research model confirm that both models predict similar improvements in bottom DO, and nearly identical water quality standards attainment, (4) the transition of the HYPOXIA_SRM (simple respiration model) to the official ROMS Ecosystem Branch.

                "text": "<p>The largest hypoxia area in U.S. coastal waters, averaging 15,000 km2, forms every summer over the Texas-Louisiana shelf in the northern Gulf of Mexico.  The formation is due to decay of organic matter that is primarily derived from nutrient inputs from the Mississippi/Atchafalaya river system.  By using nutrient management strategies in the watershed, the 2008 Action Plan (Hypoxia Taskforce, 2008) put forth by the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force hopes to reduce the size of the hypoxic zone to a running 5-year mean of 5,000 km2. In order to improve mechanistic understanding of hypoxia formation and to inform nutrient management decisions, several coupled circulation-hypoxia models are being developed for the Mississippi River outflow region.</p><p>This COMT project provides an inter-comparison of these hypoxia models and uses scenario simulations to assess the impact of potential reductions in nutrient load on hypoxia formation. Understanding how and why model predictions differ will ultimately lead to improved model formulations, improved hindcasts and forecasts, and improved mechanistic understanding.  The study is focusing on identifying factors that influence the prediction of dissolved oxygen concentration both to improve our understanding of the controlling processes and to provide guidance on the eventual implementation of dissolved oxygen forecasts in NOAA’s Northern Gulf of Mexico Operational Forecast System (NGOFS).  An inter-comparison of three coupled hydrodynamic - ecosystem models has shown that skillful hypoxia predictions in this region require accurate reproduction of bottom water temperature, bottom boundary layer thickness and vertical attenuation of short-wave solar radiation.</p><p>Scenario-based simulations are being conducted to assess the potential impacts of nutrient management decisions in the Mississippi River Basin and future climate conditions on hypoxia in the northern Gulf.  Results will inform the interagency Hypoxia Task Force’s efforts to devise near-term and long-term nutrient management strategies. Specific goals of the project include:</p><p>1. Assessing the skill of the Texan A&M University (TAMU) ROMS shelf model in predicting currents, temperature and salinity (including stratification) both as a stand along shelf model and nested within three basin models.  The four implementations tested include: (1) not nested, (2) nested within the NOAA CSDL NGOM (POM) (3) nested within the NRL IASNFS (NCOM), and (4) nested within the NRL/FSU GoM (HYCOM).  Each skill assessment uses the same data and comparable evaluation techniques.</p><p>2. Assessing the skill of the coupled Fennel ecosystem/ TAMU ROMS model in predicting biogeochemical and oxygen distributions.  The skill of biogeochemical distributions is assessed using the same four implementations of TAMU ROMS: (1) not nested, (2) nested within the NOAA CSDL NGOM (POM) (3) nested within the NRL IASNFS (NCOM), and (4) nested within the NRL/FSU GoM (HYCOM).  This approach allows evaluation of the ecosystem model consistent with the hydrodynamic model evaluation. The skill of the oxygen distributions is assessed using the Fennel ecosystem/ TAMU ROMS and the coupled EPA GEM-Ko/ NCOM, both nested with the NRL IASNFS.  This approach allows cross comparison of two hypoxia model approaches.</p><p>3. Evaluating and transitioning (from pre-operations to operations) the 3 kilometer resolution AMSEAS (NCOM) nowcast/forecast system.  This system provides near-term operational capability relevant to future operational hypoxia applications as well as real-time Coast Guard search and rescue operations, harmful algal bloom tracking, and oil spill response applications. This approach facilitates the transition of NGI Developmental OceanNOMADS to NOAA NCDDC OceanNOMADS, and the planned NODC version of NCDC National Operational Model Archive and Distribution System.</p><p>To date, the primary findings of the study include: (1) the importance of bottom water temperature and the thickness of the bottom boundary layer for hypoxia prediction, (2) the fact that hypoxic layer thickness coincides with bottom boundary layer thickness in all models, (3) a demonstration that model errors can compensate for each other such that two models can generate the same hypoxic area, but for different reasons, (4) that hypoxic volume should be considered in addition to hypoxic area, and (5) that the proper treatment of the vertical attenuation of shortwave radiation in the heat equation is extremely important.</p><p>Additional detail on the methodology and results of this project are available from the <a href=\"https://ioos.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Final_New_COMT_allhands_082516.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2016 COMT Annual Meeting Report</a> and the 2016 Semi-Annual Report.</p>"

Project objectives are to: (1) compile a data set of observations collected around Puerto Rico and the USVI by the IOOS Caribbean Regional Association; (2) evaluate multiple, coupled wave/surge/inundation models against this data; (3) recommend the most suitable model for transition to operations and (4) assist with the transition.  These outcomes will also be applicable to U.S. island regions in the Pacific and may therefore guide future implementations at NOAA’s Central Pacific Hurricane Center.</p><p>U.S. island regions in the Caribbean and Pacific pose many challenges to the accurate modeling and prediction of hazardous wave-dominated storm surge inundation events.  The relative importance of physical processes leading to inundation in steep-sloped, reef-edged island environments differs from those in milder-sloped mainland environments.  Relatively little research has been done in these environments, constituting a significant knowledge gap.  To compound this uncertainty, little observational data are available in many island environments.  As a result, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) currently lacks operational surge and inundation guidance for these regions. An exception to this general data scarcity is Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI), which frequently experience strong tropical and extra-tropical storms resulting in high waves, storm surge, and river flooding.  A large number of observational instruments have been deployed here, many by IOOS Caribbean Regional Association partners, creating a valuable resource for the evaluation and advancement of operational wave/surge/inundation models of these areas.</p><p>Three teams – an operational assessment team (federal user group), a numerical modeling team and a data management team – will work together to accomplish the following tasks:\nModel, test case and metric selection: All teams jointly define desired operational inundation model improvements in Puerto Rico and USVI, and identify candidate models to meet those needs.  The data team selects test cases for model evaluation and compiles these into an islands inundation data set, compliant with the COMT’s Cyber-Infrastructure standards.  All teams jointly define a set of metrics for model evaluation and comparison.</p><p>Model comparison over reef transects: The modeling team performs detailed cross-reef simulations with coupled spectral wave and hydrodynamic models to evaluate performance on a physics process basis.  Results are compared with observations and against phase-resolving wave models (which are too expensive for operational use, but will provide useful benchmark results).</p><p>Model comparison for regional field cases:  The modeling team performs model evaluations over complex regional field cases, featuring hurricane meteorological forcing, high-resolution bathymetry and topography, roughness values derived from benthic maps and rainfall run-off inputs.  Model performance will be compared for accuracy and computational requirements.</p><p>Final evaluation, recommendations and dissemination: All teams will compile joint recommendations regarding the most suitable model or models for near-term and long-term operational implementation.  Recommendations will also be made regarding current and future observational networks and field campaigns.  All teams will provide assistance in the transition of the recommended model, incl. setting up COMET web-based training materials, if required.</p>"

The COMT team also manages the data repository using a THREDDS catalog.  This repository is populated by the PIs with the assistance of the CI team. A data upload tool has been developed to facilitate the process of providing data for the repository. The CI team also developed and hosts a map-based viewer that allows users to visualize and perform basic plotting and analysis of the COMT project data.  Finally, the CI team maintains and enhance sciWMS, a python WMS service for gridded data.  Planned enhancements for Year 4 include updated color schemes and scales as well as support for 3D cross-sections.</p>"
